a discord bot that replies to all messages with a random "xD" - 20 to 35 "D"s
shitpost, never gonna update, fork and PR if you want to update this bot for some godforsaken reason
probably insecure in some way

how to use:
- put token into token.txt
- put serverid into guild.txt
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (yes I bothered to do that much with this shitpost)
- ???
- profit
